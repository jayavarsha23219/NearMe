    Karaikudi is the largest city in Sivaganga district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
Karaikudi Municipal Corporation is the 21st largest urban agglomeration of Tamil Nadu based on 2011 census data. 
It is part of the area commonly referred to as "Chettinad" and has been declared a City Municipal Corporation by the 
Government of Tamil Nadu,[1] on account of the palatial houses built with limestone called Kaarai veedu. For this reason, 
the place is sometimes called Kaarai Nagar locally. The main municipality is spread across 33.75 km2 and the extended 
urban limit spreads about 115 km2 (44 sq mi) which undergoes major developments as part of Government Schemes.
