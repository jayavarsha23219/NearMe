Karaikudi station was constructed as a part of Pudukkottaiâ€“Sivaganga railway line during the 1930s.
Initially during its older days this station acted as an ordinary railway station when the Tiruturaipundi 
Aranthangi line was extended to Karaikudi, it became a junction railway station. It became as a junction by 
connecting all the three terminal lines they are Manamadurai Sivagangai Railway line, Trichinopoly Pudukkottai 
Railway line and Tiruturaipundi Aranthangi Railway line. Being a junction station, three rail lines emerge from 
the station, one towards Tiruchirappalli Junction, another to Thiruthuraipoondi junction and the third and final 
one Manamadurai Junction.
